            <h2>About me</h2><p>My name is Nate Sheffield, 
                and Iâ€™m someone who wants to use my passions to help 
                as many people in the world as I can. 
                I believe that everyone in the world is 
                entitled to respect, 
                no matter what background or beliefs. 
                When I die, I want to be remembered as someone who 
                always cared more for others than himself.</p></div>
